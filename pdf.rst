Create launch links in PDF with LaTeX
.....................................

It seems this is not supported yet in the current version of the hyperref package in latex. However there is a hyperref-generic module in the works which provides a command hrefrun. I'm not sure if any of the viewers under linux support this yet, good shot is probably atril, as it opens external files (other than evince). Poppler should support it I think.
